					<i>October-December 2019</i>
					<div style="overflow:auto;">
						<b>Overview</b>
						<a href="media/robot.mp4" style="float:right;height:45vh;margin:1em;">
							<video autoplay loop class="embed-responsive-item" style="height:100%">
								<source src="media/robot.mp4" type="video/mp4">
							</video>
						</a>
						<p class="tab">Created for robotics class with a partner, this project sought to imitate a
							classical conditioning system, specifically that of dogs learning how to perform tricks
							associated with various commands. Its main purpose would most likely be for children to
							learn the basics before being let loose on a real dog.</p>
						<p class="tab">The conditioning system was essentially a dictionary of lists of probabilities of
							tricks. When a command was given, the robot would select a trick based on the list for that
							specific command. Received commands that aren't yet in the dictionary receive a default
							probability list. After performing a trick, the user could give it feedback ("good boy" or
							"bad dog") depending on whether it was the intended trick or not. This feedback would have
							less weight with each command given in quick succession - up to five minutes. Finally, the
							conditioning system saved the dictionary to a text file along with the current time. When
							the program was loaded back up, the tricks would be remembered, but would slowly go back to
							the default if it had been a while since the last training session.</p>
						<p class="tab">All in all, the robot works pretty well. Commands are given vocally with the help
							of an app, the robot randomly performs a trick, and tweaks the likelihood of performing the
							same trick upon receiving that command based on feedbadk. Additionally, the text file can be
							tweaked manually, so that the robot performs certain tricks for certain commands every time,
							as seen in the vieo to the right.</p>

						<div class="caption">
							<p>Screenshot of the app created for the RoboDog Project</p>
						</div>
						<p class="tab">While Paul did most of the research, formulas, and overview for the conditioning
							system, I took the ideas and turned them into code. Several modularized classes were created
							and combined: one that dealt with lower-level robot functions, one that worked with <a
								href="https://medium.com/@rymshasiddiqui/path-planning-using-potential-field-algorithm-a30ad12bdb08">potential
								fields</a> so it could avoid obstacles, and one that contained the entire conditioning
							system. These classes were combined to one main class that mainly just checked on what
							command it was given, then wandered using potential fields and an optical distance sensor
							until a new command was given, at which point it would repeat. I coded all four tricks the
							robot was capable of: <i>stay</i>, <i>rollover</i>, <i>come</i>, and <i>fetch</i> (and
							technically <i>wander</i> counts as a trick, but that just ignores the user, as an untrained
							dog likely would). Finally, I programmed a simple Android app in Kotlin where the user could
							enter the IP address, connect to the robot, then give voice commands to the robot. The robot
							receives these commands through another thread listening on a socket server. When a command
							is received on the socket, it interrupts the main thread to let it know that it has to stop
							wandering.</p>

					<h3>Photo.it</h3>
					<i>May 2018</i>
					<!--TODO: image of the UI-->
					<p class="tab">Created for Software Design class in freshman year along with three classmates,
						written in C++, Photo.it was an image editor, similar to Microsoft Paint or Photoshop. Users
						could load in multiple .png files into up to 10 different layers. The base layer would be the
						main image, and other layers could be resized and moved about over the base. Each layer could
						have the image cropped, be painted over, and have the backgound filled in.
						<!--TODO: what other features?--> When the user was done, the image would be saved into a .png
						file.</p>
					<p class="tab">I personally implemented the libpng library to read and write to .png files, as well
						as most of the image manipulation functions. I made the feature that allowed for multiple image
						layers, as well as a color selector and several other user interface features.</p>
					<!--UI picture down here? Because the text is pretty short and the screenshot will most likely be pretty wide-->

				<div class="item">
					<h3>This Website!</h3>
					<i>August 2019, occasional updates since</i>
					<p class="tab">If you're reading this, you've probably noticed that I have a website by now. This
						site is designed to look pretty similar to my resumé, except more in-depth and slightly more
						interactive. It's hosted by an Nginx server running on a Raspberry Pi in the basement of my
						house. Most features are pretty plain to see, but here are some that are less obvious:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>PHP/SQL:</b> Some PHP and MySQL can be seen at the bottom of the <a
								href="#skills">Skills</a> section. It allows users to rate the site (and my "Web
							Development" skills) on a scale of 1-5, and sends the user to a page displaying the average
							rating. Because users shouldn't be able to spam responses, it saves the rating along with
							the IP it was submitted with, and checks new ratings for their IP. If the IP has already
							voted, the site tells them their old rating, and gives them the option of either changing
							their rating or deleting it along with their IP.</li>
						<li><b>Visual Appeal:</b>The site uses Bootstrap to make the web page as responsive as possible,
							as well as looking great! If you're viewing this on a device with a resizeable window, I
							invite you to try resizing it now.</li>
						<li><b>Security:</b> Even though no sensitive information is being passed around yet, this page
							is HTTPS encrypted using Let's Encrypt and CertBot. Additionally, functionality for creating
							accounts and logging in are in the works, backed with research about the importance of
							hashing and salting passwords. Luckily, PHP7 provides convenient functions for dealing with
							these things: password_hash() and password_verify(). Finally, all user inputs are sanitized
							to prevent SQL injection. Before doing this, I was able to give the rate.php page undesired
							SQL queries, but now that shouldn't be possible.</li>

		<h1>Extracurriculars / Clubs</h1>
		<h3>Algorithms Club - Vice President</h3>
		<p>Created in the Spring of 2020, the Algorithms Club at St. Olaf is aimed at helping students prepare for
			technical interview questions. Students who haven't taken the Algorithms and Data Structures class are
			introduced to crucial concepts, and get used to seeing/considering these problems and concepts. Students who
			have taken Algorithms and Data Structures also greatly benefit, both from reviewing the concepts as well as
			expanding their knowledge of the subject.</p>
		<h3>StoC Engineering Team</h3>
		<p>Along with Carleton College (also in Northfield), the engineering club works very hard to compete in
			technologically challenging competititions. For example, this year, we made competed in the International
			Arial Robotics Competition (IARC) by making drones that could be controlled hands-free to perform specific
			challenges (<a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Aerial_Robotics_Competition#Eighth_mission">Wikipedia
				summary of the mission our drones competed in</a>). Our team was one of three that were able to qualify,
			and ended up completing more of the mission than any other team.</p>
		<h3>Metal Club</h3>
		<p>A bunch of idiots who love heavy metal music (such as myself) gather in an auditorium every Sunday evening to
			blast some great music before starting off their week. Each week is typically dedicated to a specific
			subgenre of metal, and sometimes we organize field trips to concerts in Minneapolis</p>
		<h3>Boxing Club</h3>
		<p>Bi-weekly meetings to practice boxing technique and occasional light sparring against each other, led by
			students. Always a great workout, and it feels good to be learning this skill (even though I'll probably
			never really use it).</p>
		<h3>German Department Activities</h3>
		<p>While not really a club, I try to show up to activities hosted by the German department as often as I can,
			because an important element in learning/retaining a language is to casually use it during leisure time.
			Besides that, I enjoy speaking the language whenever I can.</p>
		<h3>Club Soccer</h3>
		<p>Student led 1.5 hour practices every Monday/Wednesday/Friday to practice for games against other Minnesota
			club soccer teams. I proudly boast the title of <i>"most improved"</i> because I came in hardly knowing how
			to play soccer, and am now capable of kicking the ball in the general direction I want it to go...most of
			the time.</p>
