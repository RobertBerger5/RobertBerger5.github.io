      <h1>Extracurriculars</h1>
      <h3>Engineering Club</h3>
      <p>Along with Carleton College (also in Northfield), the engineering club works very hard to compete in technologically challenging competititions. For example, this year, we made competed in the International Arial Robotics Competition (IARC) by making drones that could be controlled hands-free to perform specific challenges (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Aerial_Robotics_Competition#Eighth_mission">Wikipedia summary of the mission our drones competed in</a>). Our team was one of three that were able to qualify, and ended up completing more of the mission than any other team.</p>
      <h3>Metal Club</h3>
      <p>Metalheads on campus gather every Sunday evening to unwind with some music before starting off their week. Very relaxed, and sometimes we organize field trips to concerts.</p>
      <!--<h3>ACM</h3>-->
      <h3>German Department Activities</h3>
      <p>While not really a club, I try to show up to activities hosted by the German department as often as I can, because an important element in learning/retaining a language is to casually use it during leisure time. Besides that, I enjoy speaking the language whenever I can.</p>
      <h3>Boxing Club</h3>
      <p>Mondays and Thursdays, there's student-lead boxing practices. Light sparring practice, beating up punching bags, and other exercises help to work on form and speed.</p>
