      <h2 class="title">What is Evolution?</h3>
      <p class="par">Evolution is change over time. As organisms adapt, they develop and become different
      fundamentally. There are many different factors inflicting the change. One of them is the environment. The
      environment affects how the organism lives. The organism will adapt to find food, water, and shelter. Many of
      the basics decided how the organisms were changed and how they adapted. Another of the determining factors was
      natural selection. As humans, we chose the food that looked the best and planted more of that same plant.
      Eventually all the plants began to change. All the food became bigger. That’s how humans had cultivated a food
      surplus, allowing us to get to where we are today. Many different things have to do with evolution. Everything
      alive has evolved from a common ancestor.</p>
