=================
The main page for this website is the static site that can be seen at bergerrob.com. The other pages serve as historical relics from messing around in highschool (they can't be accessed from bergerrob.com, but you can still get at them from robertberger5.github.io if you really want). Feel free to browse, I might eventually delete the older pages, but can't quite bring myself to do it just yet.
