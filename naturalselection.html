      <h3 class="title">How did natural selection influence human evolution?</h3>
      <br>
      <h3 class="title">Climate Effects</h3>
      <p class="par">Some scientists assume that several human adaptations, such as upright walking and tool
      making, were the result of only the savanna biome. However, Hominids lived in a wide variety of environments,
      so if this were true, then adaptations such as these would only be found in part of the population, not all
      of the species.</p>
      <p class="par">A more recent theory, variability selection, states that humans evolved not as a product of
      one climate, but as a result of instability in the climate over a period of time. During the evolutionary
      period, the environment and climate was ever changing as a result of temperature changes, precipitation
      changes, elevation changes due to plate tectonics, volcanic eruptions, and forest fires.</p>
      <img class="mid" src="http://www.archeolog-home.com/medias/images/oman.jpg" />
      <p class="par">After a hominin’s environment changed, they either had to find a new environment similar to
      their old one or adapt to the changes in their current one, or else they would become extinct. Given the
      adaptation to varying climates, humans evolved in a very similar way, resulting in similar adaptations
      throughout the species. Also, those who were more adaptable survived changing environments and passed on
      their DNA. Natural selection was less about survival of the fittest, but survival of the most adaptable.
      Over time, the human race became much more adaptable, allowing them to survive and continue evolve.</p>
      <p class="par">One way in which hominids survived changing climates and environments was genetic adaptation.
      During this process, different alleles are present in varied frequencies among the population. Over time, one
      allele is favored, and through natural selection, becomes much more common among the population.</p>
      <p class="par">Another way in which organisms adapt in changing environments is to evolve new structures and
      behaviors to better help them survive their environment. The change over time in structures or behaviors as a
      reaction to an unstable environment is known as Variability Selection. Variability selection differs from
      hypotheses based on a consistent environment as it shows the survival of organisms who are better able to
      cope with change.</p>
      <p class="par">The adaptation of hominins to have two legs and long arms indicates instability during the
      period of evolution. The long limbs of hominins suggests that they needed to move along in varied habitats.
      With long legs and arms, they were able to move around quickly in diverse and changing environments.</p>
      <p class="par">The development of the ability of early hominins to use stone tools to access food suggests
      they adapted to changing and varied environments, as this allowed them to utilize a large number of food
      sources. The ability to make and use stone tools aided the function of the teeth and helped them to be able
      to consume many different types to food depending on what was available in their environment.</p>
      <p class="par">The ability of early hominids to adapt to their environment not only allowed them to survive
      in many different environments, but also to survive over other lineages. Species that weren’t able to adapt
      to a changing environment as quickly often went extinct, allowing the early ancestors of Homo Sapiens to
      survive and continue to evolve.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Ancient Hominins</h3>
      <p class="par">Hominins have been found in many different habitats, such as wooded areas, grasslands with
      many grazing animals, and open savannas, but with both a wooded area and a grassland near by (see image
      below).  Dr. Jonathan Wynn researched paleosols and pedogenic carbonates to see if they are demonstrated in
      the areas that the hominins are said to have inhabited. Wynn did find that the carbonates were present in the
      time that the Australopithecus anamensis inhabited the area.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Survival of the Adaptable</h3>
      <p class="par">The first humans appeared on the earth over 200,000 years ago. These homo sapiens were much
      different then we are today.  Since they lacked the modern agriculture humans have today, they had to hunt
      and scavenge for food. Because of this hominins had to bring themselves closer to dangerous animals for
      food.  Many human fossils have been found with bite marks in their bones.  Those that were able to out run
      and out fight the predators survived, and passed on their traits.</p>
