      <h3 class="title">How did natural selection influence human evolution?</h3>
      <h3 class="title">Climate Effects</h3>
      <p class="par">Some scientists assume that several human adaptations, such as upright walking and tool
      making, were the result of only the savanna biome. However, Hominids lived in a wide variety of environments,
      so if this were true, then adaptations such as these would only be found in part of the population, not all
      of the species.</p>
      <p class="par">A more recent theory, variability selection, states that humans evolved not as a product of
      one climate, but as a result of instability in the climate over a period of time. During the evolutionary
      period, the environment and climate was ever changing as a result of temperature changes, precipitation
      changes, elevation changes due to plate tectonics, volcanic eruptions, and forest fires.</p>
