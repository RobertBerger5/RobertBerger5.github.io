      <h3>How do modern human structures support human evolution?</h3>

      <h3>Homologous Structures</h3>
      <p class="par">The tailbone is a homologous structure but itâ€™s considered vestigial.
      The tail bone is where tails would form on animals.</p>
      <p class="par">Chimp skulls and human skulls are homologous structures.  The human skull is almost the exact
      same as the chimp skull around the eyes and the cheekbone area. The human skull has more teeth that are smaller
      and finer.</p>
      
      <h3>Vestigial Structure</h3>
      <p class="par">Vestigial structure has lost much of its ancestral function. Vestigiality refers to genetically
      determined structures or attributes that have apparently lost most or all of their ancestral function in a
      given species, but have been retained through evolution. A common example is the appendix and tonsils.</p>
