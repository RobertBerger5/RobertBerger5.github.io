      <h3 class="title"> How can genetic sequencing and molecular genetics support
human evolution?</h3>
      <p class="par">The genetic difference between humans, chimpanzees and the chimps cousin the bonobo is only
      1.2%. Also, the difference between the human and gorilla genome is only 1.6%.  Due to the close relation of
      humans and chimps it is know that we shared a common ancestor that lived around 6 to 8 million years ago.
      From this common ancestor there was the split of the human lineage and the present day Chimpanzee.  Also due
      to the close relation of humans and apes humans are classified in the family called “Great Apes” (as you can
      see below).</p>

      <h3 class="title">Neanderthals</h3>
      <p class="par">About 40,000 years ago homo sapiens and neanderthals inhabited Europe together. Nearly 5,000
      years later, neanderthals were no longer a part of the Earth. Because of these known facts, it is believed
      that the homo sapiens played a large role in the destruction of the neanderthals. However the exact way the
      humans did it is unclear. The idea that homo sapiens won against the neanderthals in a war isn’t true due to
      the fact that neanderthals had vastly superior strength. One more reasonable option is that the homo sapiens,
      who were smarter, were able to gather all the resources available to the land. Without food or water to
      support the neanderthals larger bodies, they quickly started to die out.</p>
      <p class="par">Neanderthals were much like homo sapiens in their appearance, and close in their intellect.
      The only thing differencing the two was the fact that homo sapiens had developed frontal lobes. This allowed
      them to create a language, where the neanderthals didn’t have the brain capacity to do so. Neanderthals had
      very large eyes and large bodies, so their brains were devoted almost solely to movement and sight.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Mitochondria</h3>
      <p class="par">Only women can pass on mitochondrial DNA and by tracing it back through human history, it
      stops at one woman in Africa who is thought to be the mother of all homo sapiens. This is why humans are
      thought to originate from Africa because there are no other traces dating back farther than that woman in
      Africa. To answer the question of different skin colors, it is believed that since people in Africa have
      darker skin and the sun shines brighter and longer than most other places in the world, that their skin
      develops melanin which protects against ultraviolet light and skin cancers.</p>
