      <h3 class="title">How Does DNA Evidence Support Human Evolution?</h3>
      <p class="par">The genetic difference between humans, chimpanzees and the chimps cousin the bonobo is only
      1.2%. Also, the difference between the human and gorilla genome is only 1.6%.  Due to the close relation of
      humans and chimps it is know that we shared a common ancestor that lived around 6 to 8 million years ago.
      From this common ancestor there was the split of the human lineage and the present day Chimpanzee.  Also due
      to the close relation of humans and apes humans are classified in the family called “Great Apes” (as you can
      see below).</p>
