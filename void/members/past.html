<h1 class="title">Past members include:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Spencer played keyboardish drums kinda at our first liveish concert</li>
  <li>Nic hated playing guitar and wanted nothing to do with it. He is on this list because it'll piss him off</li>
  <li>Henri was in the band for like a minute until he called Slayer "death metal" and was promptly removed. He might play In Bloom for us later, tho</li>
  <li>Tino was gonna learn bass for a little bit, but wasn't feeling it. He chose to pursue his rap career instead</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow that's a surprisingly long list. We've still never had a singer, though.</p>
