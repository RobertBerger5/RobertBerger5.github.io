      <h3 class="title">How does fossil evidence support human evolution?</h3>
      <p class="par">The fossils show that the human family tree has many more branches and deeper roots than we
      knew about. It shows that decades ago we didnâ€™t know everything about the human family tree. As we look at
      fossil evidence we can see that our bone structures have changed over many years. 
      For example the skull, pelvis, and leg bone have changed into what we are today. The skull to start off has grown
      bigger over time therefore enabling our brain to grown bigger too. Also the brain cavity size grew bigger as the
      teeth and jaw size decreased. Over time if we look at the capacity of the brain we can see that it started at 650
      cubic centimeters for early humans and today it is about 1350 cubic centimeters. Comparing it to a chimpanzee which
      is roughly 300-500 cubic centimeters the modern brain today is three times bigger which would require the skull to
      accommodate to the proper size as we see the changes of the skull today.</p>

      <p class="par">Looking at the pelvic bone we can see that as chimpanzees learned to walk on their two feet
      their pelvic bone has formed into more of a bowl shape to hold their internal organs and body weight. The
      width of the pelvic bone also contributes to the length of the stride by rotating the pelvis while walking.
      As the rotation increases it would increase the length of the stride and decrease the allowance of swing in
      their step.</p>

      <p class="par">Attachment of the leg bone also played a key role in the shape of the pelvis as overtime the
      place where it attaches had changed due to vertical standing. Talking about leg bones the thigh bone enabled
      us to take longer strides which allowed us to walk farther and faster than earlier humans.</p>

      <p class="par">Lucy is the worlds most famous early human ancestor. She was an ape that was found 3.2 million
      years ago near Hadar in Ethiopia. Only 40% of her body was found but they figured out she was a female by the
      size of her body. When looking at her remains she had long dangly arms, but the rest of her body including
      the pelvis, spine, foot, and leg bone showed that she walked upright and stood 3.5 feet tall. Lucy was an
      adult female of about 25 years old.</p>
